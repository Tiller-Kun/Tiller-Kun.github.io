# Welcome to my first wbesite coding project! 🎉

This project is a simple website that I built as part of my journey into learning web development. It's nothing super serious—just a basic website with a goal of highlighting some aspects of myself and gaining hands-on experience on building websites from scratch.

🚀 About the Project - A fun about me website!

📂 How to View - You can simply paste Tiller-Kun.github.io/homepage into your browser to view the live website.

🔴 Disclaimer
This project is not a fully-featured or polished product, simply a way for me to enjoy programming and get comfortable with web development. More features will be added in a later professional website.

          <h1 class="shin mt-3">Tottenville's Growth!</h1>
          <p class="mt-3 mb-3 tyty">The Tottenville pool is in a serene neighborhood of Staten Island, houses a fine size, yards a pleasant green, and little shops spread vastly along quiet blocks. An enclave where outsiders have never heard of and even those within the borough lack knowledge of, it’s a small, sweet community with the best public pool in New York City.</p>
          <p class="mt-3 mb-3 tyty">At the Tottenville pool, you’ll see people of all different identities and ethnicities and hear the sounds of possibly every language: English, Russian, Spanish, Chinese, etc. You’ll appreciate some linguistic masterpieces of a dialect you've never heard before, as people line up on warm summer days. Kids are ecstatic about their swim lessons while parents secretly dread waiting hours in the sweltering sun before the pool opens to the public. The sun beams off the lines of tall fences whose hues have been painted over dozens of times. Sunlight reflects off the overly glistening pebbles embedded in the sidewalk as people await the opening metal doors. Swimmers rush into the musty locker rooms already damp from prior “cleaning” and through the cramped spaces where much urine filled air wafts around (think of NYC subway stations). You rush in and the light is near, not like the light of death, but one of vigor and rebirth via an oasis. A place to learn and relax amongst colorful walls, PSA posters, designs created by the city, looming lifeguard chairs, instructors inside their little penguin-embellished safety office, individuals splashing around in their colorful swimwear while others are barely garbed in their underwear, slippery ramps or stairs, and much more to take in, but most of all, no one can deny the slightly rippling, crystalline water.</p>
          <p class="mt-3 mb-3 tyty">Personally, the Tottenville complex is split into exactly two other parts (besides the main pool), which you’d never consider, had you not been to each. There's the kiddie pool, a shallow twenty-four foot square precisely eighteen inches deep, with plenty of room for tots to wade around and for parents sitting along yellow concrete benches. The kiddie pool, situated in the little corner up the ramp marked that your summer as a toddler began, sadly I quickly got too old for that satisfaction. The most underrated part of Tottenville was the playground and benches on the outskirts of the gates. During the pool’s cleaning break, we “dried off” and they’d hand out NYC’s summer lunches. Granted they were somewhat thawed and soggy school food, but it felt nice to sit with others, eat, and converse. After I wolfed down my sandwich I raced to be the first to propel down the playground slide. I often took a stab at the monkey bars whose rungs I lacked the strength to cling onto, only briefly hovering over scattered woodchips on the ground.</p>
          <p class="mt-3 mb-3 tyty">Tottenville Pool was representative of self-development from the very start. When I first arrived I was too young to remember what happened, I’ve been told about lessons where my mother swam with me. I’m glad I was brought there from a young age. Not only can I swim well now, but I’ve learned the importance of growing, watching yourself develop a skill, and experiencing something you love. My personal memory is jumbled, filled with years of eyeing the plastered cement wall right outside, changing colors and designs. My earliest memory was a maple leaf on a fading blue background. Everyone who’s visited can recall their first view of the out of place cement wall, representative of realizing you belong. I walked in for my first swimming lesson staring at that wall, clenching my towel, and expressing my nervousness. Regardless, I had already developed a passion for water and anxiously went ahead. I remember several supportive instructors and how their personalities and kindness reassure me to this day. Antonio, an average-height, muscular, Hispanic teenager who was extremely nice to everyone, taught me the ropes. I remember how he’d be right beside me, encouraging me yet ready to rescue me if I blundered. Then there was Crystal, an older Asian lady who provided constant love, she’d always tell us to “bubble” as we performed different strokes repeatedly. Additionally, she’d prepare us for the real world by explaining how to be safe: swimming along the tides to avoid being swept out by rough currents, or how to aid a drowning person.</p>
          <p class="mt-3 mb-3 tyty">Tottenville has undoubtedly changed over the years, and so have I. My conscience longs for the same simplicity, a greater opportunity for growth and guidance, but most aspects, like a leaf in the pool, have drifted. I too should move on. As I mature and take on increasing responsibilities I’m losing free time to visit the pool every summer weekend. Regardless I’m grateful to have experienced a plethora of enlightening opportunities. Change can be scary for anyone, nevertheless, I look forward to going back to my sacred place to see how we’ve both fared with the passage of time. Tottenville pool is more than enjoying a swim, it's a stepping stone for a diverse community. It's about a place of belonging and being a friend amongst New Yorkers in their strive for growth.</p>
